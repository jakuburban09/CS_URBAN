# CS_URBAN


This project is used for the selection process at Česká Spořitelna for the position of SmartCase Designer. 

For proper functionality, download the project, open the folder, go to the BE folder and install node_modules using the terminal command "npm i". Then enter the node app.js command.

Then just go back to the root folder, open the FE folder and open the "index.html" file.

The project contains a total of four screens. The first screen, called "index.html", is the project welcome page. The "Fill KYC Form" button redirects you to the second screen "form.html" with the form you need to fill out, otherwise you won't get to the next screen. On the third screen "summary.html" you can check the completed data and send it to the backend. When the data is sent successfully, a popup will notify you if the data was sent successfully and you will be redirected to the first screen "index.html". When you click the "Data from backend" button, you will be redirected to the last screen "dataFromBackend.html" and when you click the "GetData" button, you will get the data from the backend, displayed in a table.
